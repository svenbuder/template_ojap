# An adjusted template of the Open Journal of Astrophysics for RSAA students

This template is an adjusted version of the template provided by the Journal here: https://astro.theoj.org/for-authors.

## How do I use it?

I like to keep papers and analysis scripts online to be able to share code and text with others. That means I have my data (data/), my code (*.ipynb) and the figures (figures/*.png or figures/*.pdf) that it produces in the same repository as my manuscript (*.tex). The combination of GitHub and Overleaf allows you to write your analysis code locally, your manuscript online and easily keep everything synchronised.

### Create GitHub and Overleaf accounts

Before you interact with this template, I suggest to sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com) with an education account and to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) with a professional account — these are both *free* (for you) if you use your ANU email address. To connect them, you have to link your GitHub account to your Overleaf one.

### Create a new GitHub repository for your research project based on this template

You can then copy this template as a new GitHub repository into your space by clicking onto the green button "Use this template" -> "Create new repository" and give it a descriptive name. Make sure to mark it as "Private" and not "Public".

### Clone your new repository onto your local (super-)computer

You will code locally either on your own or a supercomputer. For that purpose, you need to clone your new repository onto your (super-)computer and should create a token between your computer and GitHub so that you can upload (git add/commit/push) files to the online repository.

Keep in mind that for a research paper, you want to also publish your code (it is not compulsory, but a good scientist should do it for reproducibility). That also means to code and comment well. Nowadays that is much easier thanks to Jupyter notebooks — so make use of the commenting functions and subtitles that you can include in these notebooks.

### Import your new repository into Overleaf.

The last step of setting your project up is to import the repository from GitHub into Overleaf. To do that, click on *New Project* -> *Import from GitHub* and find the right repository.

Good luck with your research.
